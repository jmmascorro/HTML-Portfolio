        <p>Aspiring C# / ASP.NET web developer. I've always been interested in technology and how things work. 
            From the early days of myspace and unknowingly using code to make and design homepages. 
            I enjoy problem solving and design and decided to pursue an education in software development.  
            I aspire to being able to develop and create applications that are enjoyable and functionally easy to use.
